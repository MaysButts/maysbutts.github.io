		<p style="font-size: 25px">My Name is Gregory Hill, and the first thing about me is how motivated I am when it comes to my school work. Reason I say this is never in my life I have tried so hard in school and realizing it is the best part of me and I would not want to take it for granted. Another thing about me is I like to play sports and to be direct I like to play basketball and I'm really good as I believe. Basketball is one thing I like to do to not thing about stuff that bother me so I play to get away.</p>
<br>
	<p style="font-size: 25px"> One thing I like to do is play video games. One game in particular is "Fortnite" because its something fun and one thing to play with you friends to just chill and try to have a good time. Another thing is I am very smart. Reason I say this is I am very good in school I pay attention and I and I catch on fast.</p>

		<p style="font-size: 21px">My name is Leigh Allen and I am going to tell you a little about myself. I am a student of Martin Luther King Jr. High School and I am a rising 10th grader of the school.  I am very proud that I have made it through the first years of high school with a good start and I will continue for the rest of my high school life till I graduate to push on and get even better than when I started. I am a very innovative person and likes to help people that really want the help instead of just letting others do it for them and call it helping. I think when you help people that they should know more than when they started. </p> 
	<br>
	<br>
		<p style="font-size: 21px"> I'm also a very fast learner and I am currently learning a little French for myself and my mother so that I can teach her too so she won't really have to buy anything or have any excuse about how she can't really learn another language and that she never has enough time to do it. she really has a few things to do but I want to be the one who can say that I taught my mother a language and that I helped her with so many things ever since the day that I taught her. I work really good with people but I donâ€™t really want to be in anything that I have to be with a lot of people which is so crazy but I help when its needed and I am very gifted when it needs planning I have been told that o should be a tactician. </p>
