		<h1>Herpes Prevention Project</h1>
<div id="para3">
<p>Herpes Prevention Project (HPP) is an organization that strives to answer a simple but imperative question. How might we spread prevention methods of Herpes to young adults? The way we strive to answer that question is through interactive modern techniques that are intriguing and engaging. We have developed a company that provides young adults with preventative methods by creating a drone service that brings preventative items to you wherever you may be. The drone brings condoms to you and in the near future it will offer many more items that are not yet mentioned but they will be worth it. The “HPP” app is where you will be able to purchase these items and the drone service but as of now it is available through a seperate website. The drone service is so amazing because it gives young adults the protection they need in under 30 mins. This cuts down on carbon emissions and provides a safe and less stressful way of getting protection. Some young adults don’t have access to protection like condoms, and some feel that the moment is more important than waiting until you can get somewhere to get some type of protection which in the end can lead to STDs like Herpes which is non-curable. Head over to our comments page with suggestions on improvement and things you would like to see. </p>
